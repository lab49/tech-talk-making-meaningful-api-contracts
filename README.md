Backend devs would like their APIs to be understood, and used to its fullest, while frontend devs would like to have a stable API and data model that they understand and can rely on. 
 
In this presentation, Lab49 engineer Balazs Edes will show you a tool he's been building to achieve this using Typescript + OpenAPI (Swagger) + code generation. There's a short presentation, then live coding with many examples.
